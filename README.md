## Description

This project aims to classify sounds using data processing techniques and machine learning. The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder, and metadata is defined in the `.env` file for data identification and processing. The metadata is consolidated into a single file, `metadata_unificado.csv`, which is generated by the script `load_metadata.py`.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following components installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/lasalle-sound-classification.git
   cd lasalle-sound-classification
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables in the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DATA_ROOT="data"
   METADATA_IDENTIFIER="metafile"
   ```

## Usage

1. Running the Scripts
   `python`

2. Import the required functions:

```
>>> from main import analyze_class_balance
>>> from main import load_metadata
>>> from main import exploratory_data_analysis
```

3. Load the dataset:
   `>>> dataset = load_metadata()`

4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):
   `>>> exploratory_data_analysis(dataset)`

5. Analyze class balance and save the chart:
   `>>> analyze_class_balance(dataset)`

The results, including visualizations and the consolidated metadata file, will be saved in the project directory as `output/unified_metadata.csv`.
